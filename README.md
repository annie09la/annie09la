- 👋 Hi, I’m @annie09la (Annie).
- 👀 I’m interested in digital art, animation, tennis, video games, and scrolling through Youtube/Netflix.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML & CSS Web Design from FreeCodeCamp.org. It has been an exciting journey so far testing my brain and creativity.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UX/UI design projects to put these skills to the test. I look forward to learning more languages and be exposed to the coding community.  
- 📫 Feel free to message me and share your knowledge.
